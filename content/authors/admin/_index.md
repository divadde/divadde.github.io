Davide Di Stefano is a PhD student at TU Wien in the field of artificial intelligence. After completing his studies at the University of Calabria in computer engineering specializing in AI & Machine Learning, he joined the innovative Austrian research project as a PhD student: Bilateral-AI. The goal of the project is to develop solutions and research in the context of neurosymbolic artificial intelligence.

Research interests are particularly focused on the study of Large Language Models in the context of Data Curation. Retrieval-Augmented Generation solutions, agentic patterns, and integration of symbolic systems with LLMs are the topics particularly studied.

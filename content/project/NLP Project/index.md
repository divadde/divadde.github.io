This project implements a **Multimodal Information Retrieval** system specifically tailored for the medical domain. The core objective is to bridge the gap between visual data (scans, X-rays) and textual reports.

**Technical Approach:**
* **Feature Extraction:** Utilized deep learning models to extract semantic features from both images (via CNNs/ViTs) and text (via Transformers/BERT).
* **Cross-Modal Alignment:** Implemented techniques to map these features into a shared latent space, allowing the system to retrieve the most relevant images given a text query and vice-versa.
* **Application:** This approach is critical for assisting diagnostic processes, enabling "text-to-image" search in large medical databases.

This project aligns with my research interest in combining different data modalities to enhance knowledge retrieval and curation.

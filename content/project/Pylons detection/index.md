This Computer Vision project addresses the problem of automating infrastructure inspection by detecting electricity pylons from images. 

**Methodology:**
* **Data Preparation:** The dataset was preprocessed with augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
* **Model Architecture:** A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** was designed and trained to classify and localize pylons within complex backgrounds.
* **Performance:** The model achieved high accuracy in distinguishing pylons from other landscape features, proving its potential utility for automated grid monitoring and maintenance planning.

The project explores the challenges of object detection in outdoor environments, such as varying lighting conditions and occlusions.

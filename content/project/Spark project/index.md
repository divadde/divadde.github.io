This project focuses on the analysis of a large dataset of hotel reviews using **Apache Spark**. The goal was to build a scalable pipeline capable of processing massive amounts of unstructured text data to perform **Sentiment Analysis**.

**Key Technologies:**
* **Apache Spark (PySpark):** Used for distributed data processing.
* **Spark MLlib:** Implemented for the machine learning pipeline (Tokenization, StopWords removal, TF-IDF, and Classification).
* **Visualization:** Data insights were visualized to understand the correlation between review length, rating, and sentiment.

The system efficiently handles data ingestion, preprocessing, and model training, demonstrating the capability to scale standard NLP tasks to a Big Data environment.

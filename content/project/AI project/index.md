This project explores **Symbolic Artificial Intelligence** through the implementation of automated planning systems. 

**Highlights:**
* **Modeling:** Domains and problems were modeled using standard planning languages (e.g., PDDL).
* **Algorithms:** Utilization of search algorithms (like A*) and heuristics to find optimal plans for agents in constrained environments.
* **Reasoning:** The system demonstrates how an agent can reason about its actions and consequences to achieve a specific goal state from an initial configuration.

This work serves as a foundational study in classical AI planning and problem-solving strategies.
